Bob the Squirrel chronicles the life and times of Bob, a squirrel and Frank, the human he&apos;s taken in as his own. Other ingredients in this comic strip stew include Frank&apos;s girlfriend- the effervescent &quot;foofy coffee chick&quot; Lezley, her daughter Lauren and Maggie, the overly protective pug mix. And to complete the meal, why don&apos;t we throw in Frank&apos;s dog, a jack russell terrier named Lucy---a dog who loves to climb trees, eat nacho chips and generally be the yang to Bob&apos;s ying. There&apos;s something for everyone in Bob the Squirrel... so, make a daily stop to see what&apos;s going on. You will not be disappointed.</string>

                <string>Ginger Meggs, Australia&apos;s most popular and longest-running comic strip, was created in the early 1920s by Jimmy Bancks.

Ginger first appeared in Us Fellers on 13 November 1921, drawn by Bancks.[1] When Bancks died on 1 July 1952 from a heart attack, Ron Vivian took over the strip (1953-1973), followed by Lloyd Piper (1973-1982), James Kemsley (1983-2007) and since 2007, Jason Chatfield...</string>

Litter-droppers, telemarketers and other miscreants are all vaporised painlessly by ray gun, leaving a nicer world. Alex Hallatt came up with Human Cull after seeing someone dropping litter. She didn’t want to confront him, but channelled her frustration into a little green man who could. Alex also has a syndicated comic strip called Arctic Circle and illustrates all sorts of other things that you can see at www.alexhallatt.com. Her first chapter book for kids, FAB (Friends Against Bullying) Club is now out in paperback.</string>

                <string>If by some strange happenstance you have never before seen a Kliban cat drawing, you will instantly recognize that each and every one of them captures the essence of…. cat. A well-established illustrator and cartoonist (Playboy, The New Yorker, Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head, et al) B. Kliban used to devote off-moments in his studio to drawing his felines Nitty, Norton, Burton Rustle and Noko Marie the Snake. An editor friend saw this work and convinced Kliban to let her take it publishers, and in 1975 Workman published CAT, a huge bestseller which inspired an outbreak of cat love that has not abated to this day. That groundbreaking book was followed by more books, and more drawings, which manifested on calendars, cards, mugs, ceramics, clothing – almost 9,000 unique items to date. And the book that started it all is still in print. Cat people of the world, rejoice -- and savor the twice-a-week pleasure of KLIBAN’S CATS.</string>

                <string>Drive down any main street in America and you will undoubtedly pass by at least one, most likely two or three restaurants of the fast food variety. Pushing burgers, tacos, fried chicken and milk shakes, these quick stops have become a familiar source of comfort for travelers far from home and a favorite stop for a late-night snack. Mark Pett’s LUCKY COW delves into the humor of the fast food, minimum wage experience, as teenagers struggle to balance school, their social lives and working at Lucky Cow and the managers hope to keep major disasters to a minimum during peak business hours. It all adds up to a hilarious combination.</string>

                <string>SPEECHLESS is based on the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words. It&apos;s mainly visual humor, with the occasional poignant episode thrown in for some relief/balance. At times it may take a bit more observational skills on the part of the reader, but hopefully that very fact will increase the reader&apos;s rewards when they finally &quot;get it&quot;. And appropriately enough, animals which for the most part are &quot;speechless&quot;, will play a majority role in the feature.</string>

                <string>When my melon goes off on a free-style cerebral stroll, untethered from the constraints of boring stuff like logic and reason it sometimes just meanders aimlessly for a while and then eventually returns empty handed. Other times however, it comes back bearing some interesting little nuggets. For example; an idea for a weird invention or toy, a goofy little animation, a quirky memory from childhood or a slightly dark gag cartoon. Who knows what the wandering melon is going to drag home from its journeys?! OK, ok enough of the melon analogies. The Wandering Melon comic is a collection of “art” resulting from whatever ideas pop into my head. This makes it a little hard to categorize but hopefully it will put a smile on your face or at least make you say, “Hmmm, that was odd”. I hope that you all become HARDCORE and REPEAT Melons!</string>

                <string>A rarity in the comics, 9 Chickweed Lane spotlights music and dance with superb artistry that complements Brooke McEldowney&apos;s strong-minded characters. A popular comic strip about three generations of family, 9 Chickweed Lane features strong characters, flights of fancy and an intuitive grasp of all kinds of relationships. The strip was recognized in 2006 for its brilliant artistry and intellectual humor when it was named Best Newspaper Comic Strip by the National Cartoonists Society. The strip appears in 60 newspapers worldwide, including the Los Angeles Times, Houston Chronicle, Calgary Sun and Columbus Dispatch. Central character Edda Burber is dancing to the beat of a different drummer these days as McEldowney focuses 9 Chickweed Lane more on the story of a young woman who moves away from home to perform with a prestigious metropolitan ballet company in New York City. Although it may seem like a completely new strip, 9 Chickweed Lane is peopled with very familiar friends, like furry feline Solange, and Edda&apos;s childhood friend and recent love interest, Amos.</string>

                <string>A 347-acre agricultural and residential estate in Kent, England, hit the market earlier this month for £5.675 million (US$7.25 million), according to a spokesperson for BTF Partnership, the brokerage representing the property.

                    But, if Snowy Hydro's project goes ahead, there are concern boats could be banned from using the waterway while construction works are completed.</string>

                <string>After nearly forty years of marriage, JOAN and JOE CASTLEMAN (Glenn Close and Jonathan Pryce) are complements. Where Joe is casual, Joan is elegant. Where Joe is vain, Joan is self-effacing. And where Joe enjoys his very public role as Great American Novelist, Joan pours her considerable intellect, grace, charm, and diplomacy into the private role of Great Man's Wife. Joe is about to be awarded the Nobel Prize for his acclaimed and prolific body of work. Joe's literary star has blazed since he and Joan first met in the late 1950. THE WIFE interweaves the story of the couple's youthful passion and ambition with a portrait of a marriage, thirty-plus years later - a lifetime's shared compromises, secrets, betrayals, and mutual love.</string>

                <string>Agnes Varda and JR have things in common: their passion for images in general and more particularly questionning the places where they are showed, how they are shared, exposed. Agnès chose cinema. JR chose to create open-air photographic galleries.When Agnès and JR met in 2015, they immediately wanted to work together, shoot a film in France, far from the cities. Random encounters or prepared projects, they will go towards the others and get them to follow them on their trip with JR's photographic truck. The film is also about their friendship that grows during the shooting, between surprises and malice, laughing of their differences.</string>

                <string>Drawn from a cache of personal video recordings from the past 22 years, director Steve Loveridge's Sundance award winning MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A. is a startlingly personal profile of the critically acclaimed artist, chronicling her remarkable journey from refugee immigrant to pop star. She began as Matangi. Daughter of the founder of Sri Lanka's armed Tamil resistance, she hid from the government in the face of a vicious and bloody civil war. When her family fled to the UK, she became Maya, a precocious and creative immigrant teenager in London. Finally, the world met her as M.I.A. when she emerged on the global stage, having created a mashup, cut-and-paste identity that pulled from every corner of her journey along the way; a sonic sketchbook that blended Tamil politics, art school punk, hip-hop beats and the unwavering, ultra-confident voice of a burgeoning multicultural youth. Never one to compromise on her vision, Maya kept her camera rolling throughout. MATANGI / MAYA / M.I.A. provides unparalleled, intimate access to the artist in her battles with the music industry and mainstream media as her success and fame explodes, becoming one of the most recognizable, outspoken and provocative voices in music today.</string>

"Teen Titans GO! to the Movies" finds our egocentric, wildly satirical Super Heroes in their first feature film extravaganza - a fresh, gleefully clever, kid-appropriately crass and tongue-in-cheek play on the superhero genre, complete with musical numbers. It seems to the Teens that all the major superheroes out there are starring in their own movies everyone but the Teen Titans, that is!  But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick.  If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them.  With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream.  But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously super villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry.  The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line!</string>

Overall, this creates a well-balanced package. We are particularly happy with the 3:2 screen. Unfortunately, the manufacturer has not improved connectivity.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>Just over a year ago, Microsoft presented its first notebook, the Surface Laptop. This year's update is simply named Surface 2 and follows the basic concept of its predecessor. The largest changes are the new quad-core processor and the matte-black model. The unusual 3:2 display remains the same and is still rather unique in the world of notebooks. Particularly productive applications benefit from the additional vertical space that is available in comparison to normal 16:9 panels.
                    
                    Our test unit is named LQN-00004 and is currently available from $1500. The configuration includes the current Core i5-8250U processor, 8 GB of RAM and a 256-GB NVMe SSD. Users can also choose a stronger Core i7, 16 GB of RAM or larger storage devices (512 GB or 1024 GB). Some of these options are limited to certain color schemes or hardware combinations, which makes things rather complicated.</string>

                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Great value for money While gaming notebooks are becoming more expensive and many manufacturers are outperforming each other with new maximum prices, Medion continues to deliver well-priced laptops. Read on to find out how the Erazer X6805 performs against other budget gaming laptops.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>Medion is a German electronics company that is owned by Lenovo. The company currently sells through Aldi in the US and through retailers such as Argos in the UK. The price comparison website geizhals.de states that Medion currently sells six different versions of the X6805 that are distinguishable by the differing components with which they are equipped. All models have the same NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. The entry-level model is powered by an Intel Core i5-8300H quad-core processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD, but it does not come with an OS. By contrast, our test device is powered by a more powerful Core i7-8750H processor, has 16 GB of RAM, a 256 GB SSD and a 1 TB HDD. There is also a Core i7-8750H model with 8 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD or a Core i5-8300H version with 16 GB of RAM.</string>

                <string>Apple MacBook Air 2018 (i5, 256 GB) Laptop Review</string>
                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Better display and slow processor. Apple pretty much ignored its MacBook Air for a couple of years and there was much speculation about the end of the series. Now, we get a completely redesigned model including a modern display.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>Apple's MacBook Air was once the lightest and most compact MacBook on the market, but the basic design remained identical since 2012 and the manufacturer only updated some of the components. Our last review of the MacBook Air was in mid 2017, and it appeared very outdated, especially compared to Apple's own MacBook 12. Neither the comparatively large footprint nor the low-resolution TN panel could keep up with the Windows competition anymore, either.
                    
                    The new Apple MacBook Air gets a new chassis, which looks almost identical to the MacBook Pro and shares the same footprint. However, the front of the MacBook Air is once again tapered and only measures 0.41 cm at its slimmest spot. The weight was reduced by about 100 grams compared to the old model and the new Air sits between the MacBook 12 and the MacBook Pro 13.</string>

                <string>Razer Blade Stealth (i7-8565U, GeForce MX150) Laptop Review</string>
                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>An Ultrabook for gamers. The new Blade Stealth proves that not all GeForce MX150 GPUs are created equal.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>The Blade Stealth series is Razer's version of the common Ultrabook. Whereas the Blade 14, Blade 15, and Blade Pro series are first and foremost ultra-thin gaming laptops, the Blade Stealth utilizes ULV CPUs to compete directly against brandname flagship Ultrabooks including the Dell XPS 13, HP Spectre 13, Huawei MateBook X Pro, Asus Zenbook UX433, Lenovo Yoga C930, Samsung Series 9 NP900X3N, and the MacBook Pro 13 by extension.
                    
                    What makes this latest Blade Stealth so different from the competition isn't the narrow-bezel design as all the aforementioned Windows alternatives also incorporate narrow bezels in some way. Instead, it's the discrete full-power GeForce MX150 GPU that gives the Razer Ultrabook a notable graphical edge. Users who want the form factor of a sleek Ultrabook but with the graphics prowess to play the latest eSports titles should find the new Razer more appealing.
                    
                    Current configurations include the Whiskey Lake-U Core i7-8565U CPU with 8 GB of RAM, integrated UHD 620 graphics, 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD, and 1080p display for $1400 USD up to the Core i7-8565U with 16 GB of RAM, GeForce MX150 graphics, 512 GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and 4K UHD touchscreen for $1900 USD. Our test model today is the middle option with the Core i7 CPU, MX150 GPU, and 1080p panel.</string>

                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Alien on a diet. Alienware's first ultra-thin laptop maintains the spirit of the original Alienware 15 R4 while propelling the series forward into the super-light gaming category. </string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>Unveiled in October, the Alienware m15 is Dell's answer to the increasing demand for thin-and-light enthusiast gaming laptops made popular by the advent of Nvidia's Max-Q series. The traditional mainline Alienware 13, 15, and 17 series that we've been familiar with all these years just can't compete against the sleeker, sharper, and lighter MSI GS65, Asus Zephyrus GX501/GX531, Gigabyte Aero 15X, or Razer Blade 15 that have since appeared. Thus, pressure was on Dell to shrink the Alienware 15 form factor into something more bite-sized and the result is what we have here today in our labs.
                    
                    As of this writing, SKUs are limited to the Core i7-8750H CPU with either GTX 1060 standard or GTX 1070 Max-Q graphics and a potential for GTX 1080 by early next year. Display options range from 1080p60 to 1080p144 or 2160p60 (or 4K UHD). Our test unit on hand is the upper mid-range SKU retailing for about $1900 USD.
                    
                    Dell has made it clear that the Alienware m15 is its own series and that it will not replace the existing Alienware 15 lineup anytime soon. Even so, we'll be comparing it directly to the Alienware 15 R4 to catch the pros and cons of the smaller chassis as well the aforementioned ultra-thin alternatives that the new Alienware is competing with.</string>

                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Compact gaming racer. The Omen 15 brings all the current computer games smoothly to the matte Full HD display. Hewlett-Packard uses a very responsive 144-Hz IPS panel here, and the rest of the equipment is also all right: NVMe SSD, 32 GB of working memory, Thunderbolt 3.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>The Omen 15 is not unknown to us. A few months ago we tested an entry-level model of the series with the Omen 15-dc0001ng, which is currently available for about 950 Euros (~$1084). With the Omen 15-dc0015ng, we now have the current top model of the Omen-15 series. You have to pay almost 2100 Euros (~$2396; for example ~$1600 in the US without the HDD) for this laptop, but the computer is correspondingly well-equipped with a Core i7-8750H processor, GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q GPU, 32 GB of working memory, NVMe SSD, HDD, and Thunderbolt 3. The competitors include devices like the MSI P65 8RF-451 - Creator, the Asus Zephyrus S GX531GS, the Schenker XMG Neo 15, the Razer Blade 15, and the MSI GE63 Raider RGB 8RF-008.
                    
                    Since both Omen models have an identical build, we will not discuss the case, equipment, input-devices, and speakers again, but you can find the corresponding information in the Omen 15-dc0001ng review.</string>

                <string>Core i9-9900K and Quadro P5200 in one laptop. For about $5000+ USD, professional users can get what is essentially a high-end desktop wrapped in a 17.3-inch chassis. Performance is indubitably fast, but not as fast as it could have been in regards to the CPU.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>The Eurocom Tornado F7W mobile workstation is the 17.3-inch version of the 15.6-inch Tornado F5W we checked out late last year. Like most Eurocom laptops, the F7W is packed to the brim with the latest hardware features and a wide array of options. Users can choose to go simple with a "basic" Core i7-8700 CPU, Quadro P3000 GPU, and a 120 Hz FHD display or go all out for the Core i9-9900K, Quadro P5200 GPU, and 4K UHS option. RAM can be configured up to 128 GB across four SODIMM slots as initially promised by the reseller. Xeon processors and ECC RAM are also available for added performance stability. We recommend checking out the product page here for the full list of customizable features.
                    
                    Our test unit today is a high-end configuration retailing for about $7000 USD. Much of the price markup can be attributed to the 3x Samsung SSD 970 PRO SSDs and 64 GB of DDR4 RAM on our unit, so it's possible to get the system for much less by dialing down the storage and RAM. Competitors in the 17.3-inch workstation category include the Dell Precision 7720, Lenovo ThinkPad P71/P72, and the HP ZBook 17 series. Unlike these alternatives, however, the Eurocom is more powerful, serviceable, and upgradeable all in one.</string>

                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Well-dressed high performer! MSI's Prestige series promises desktop-level performance while maintaining maximum mobility at the same time. We have decided to take a closer look at whether MSI managed to keep its promises.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>With the P65 Creator 8RE, 8RD, and 8RF MSI introduced three new Prestige-series devices that are basically three different trim models of the same base unit. All three share some commonalities, such as the Intel Core i7-8750H CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. This should make for a solid basis.
                    
                    The most obvious difference is case color, and only the Limited Edition features a completely white aluminum case. The two less-expensive P65 models feature a low-key silver case. Another Limited Edition exclusive is the GPU, as it is the only one available with a GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q with 8 GB of VRAM. The P65 Creator entry-level model features a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti instead, and it starts at around $1,600. At the time of writing, our review unit sold for more than $2,300.
                    
                    In order to have an extensive range of comparability we have picked competitors from the realms of multimedia, gaming, and workstations. Keep in mind that the MSI P65 Creator is not a true workstation notebook, and MSI is offering a portable workstation as well (WS65).
                    
                    Its primary competitors are the Asus ZenBook Pro 15 and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme. From the realm of gaming, we picked the Gigabyte Aero 15X v8 and the Asus ROG Strix GL504.</string>

                <string>Too much power? After checking out the Core i5 and Core i7 SKUs, we're now finally ready to benchmark the Core i9 version of the XPS 15 9570.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>The XPS 15 is Dell's premier consumer laptop and it carries premier hardware to back it all up. While 15-inch laptops aren't uncommon, the XPS 15 is special for being so thin and compact while offering Core i9, discrete Nvidia graphics, and 4K touchscreen options all in one.
                    
                    Our test unit today represents the highest-end configuration that the XPS 15 9570 has to offer and we're especially excited to see how it performs when compared to the lower-end Core i5 and i7 SKUs. We recommend checking out our existing reviews on the XPS 15 for more information on the chassis, display, and its features since the visual design of the XPS 15 9570 has remained essentially unchanged since the XPS 15 9550 days. Our review here will instead focus on the CPU and its supposed advantages over the Core i7 alternative.</string>

                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>After the GX501 that was only mobile to a limited extent in favor of incorporating G-Sync, the brand-new GX531 is able to score with Nvidia's Optimus graphics switching. Find out in this extensive review why the overall evaluation is still worse than its predecessor's. Update: CPU and GPU Turbo mode benchmarks added.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>Asus will offer two variants of the ROG Zephyrus S in the market: While the GX531GM has a GeForce GTX 1060, in the more expensive GX531GS that we tested there is a GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q under the hood.
                    
                    The rest of the components are to a large extent identical. Both models use a hexa-core processor from Intel, the Core i7-8750H to be exact. In addition, there is a PCIe-SSD with a capacity between 256 and 1000 GB. The display is a matte Full HD panel that promises a fast response time of 144 Hz. There is at least 16 GB of working memory, with 8 GB of that being onboard and not configured as a SO-DIMM module, which is a negative point in our opinion. Most of the competitors offer two DDR4-RAM slots.
                    
                    The competitors of the GX531GS include other 15-inch laptops with slim bezels and the GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q, such as the Gigabyte Aero 15X v8 (88%), the Razer Blade 15 (87%), and the MSI GS65 Stealth (86%). We also include the old GX501 (85%), which had wide bezels, in our charts as a comparison device.</string>

Now we will catch up with a comprehensive review of the current model, which is equipped with the quite new Intel Core i7-8750H and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. Our comparison devices for this review will include the Asus Strix GL703GM-DS74 and the less expensive Asus TUF FX705GM, both of which are equipped with the same processor. The new Sabre will also come up against the MSI GP72VR 7RFX and the once-dominant Razer Blade Pro RZ09-0220, two devices with older processors but the same GPU.
                    
                    Our review reveals whether the "saber's" blade is equally sharp for various applications—home office tasks, video editing and gaming—and where the 17-inch powerhouse's weak spots are.</string>

                <string>Schenker XMG Ultra 17 (i9-9900K, GTX 1080, UHD) Clevo P775TM1-G Laptop Review</string>
                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Anybody looking for a powerful desktop replacement is at the right address with the XMG Ultra 17 from Schenker Technologies. We evaluate whether the cooling system offers sufficient reserves for its top equipment with the Core i9-9900K and GeForce GTX 1080. Update: The reason for the GPU throttling was found, and there is a higher score due to new software.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>The best example for this is our test unit, which is equipped with 32 GB of DDR4-RAM (2x 16 GB @2666 MHz), a 1000 GB NVMe-SSD, and Nvidia's currently fastest laptop GPU, the GeForce GTX 1080. In combination with the Pascal chip, you can get an Intel processor from the i5, i7, or i9 series.
                    
                    The kicker is that since Schenker uses desktop models, the processor is not – as we know it from most notebooks – soldered in, but can be replaced if needed. The same goes for the graphics card. However, there are some limits in the upgrade options (software support, availability of the hardware, power supply, cooling, etc.). Of course, all this technology has its price: With the Core i9-9900K, 4K display, and Windows 10 Home 64 Bit, our test unit costs almost 4000 Euros (~$4553).</string>

                <string>Apple MacBook Pro 15 2018 (2.6 GHz, 560X) Laptop Review</string>
                <key>shortDesc</key>
                <string>Handbrake Deluxe. Apple finally ships the MacBook Pro 15 with the new Intel processors. They feature 6 cores and should increase the multi-core performance significantly. At least in theory, because a comparison with the predecessor shows that the advantage is not always that big.</string>
                <key>longDesc</key>
                <string>Apple did not just update the smaller MacBook Pro 13 2018 (here in review), but the 15-inch sibling received new components as well. The highlight is obviously the new processor with 6 cores, so the performance should be much significantly better in multi-core applications. Besides two Core i7 CPU, you can also select a Core i9 processor for the first time. However, the big question is whether the cooling solution of the MacBook Pro 15 can handle the new CPUs.
                    
                    The step from LPDDR3 towards DDR4-RAM (2400 MHz) is another important step and the MacBook Pro now finally supports up to 32 GB memory. The PCIe-SSD has a maximum capacity of up to 4 TB, but there is not much to tell about the GPUs. The two AMD Radeon Pro GPUs are based on their predecessors Radeon Pro 555 and Radeon Pro 560, respectively. The clocks are a bit higher and the smaller Radeon Pro 555X is now equipped with twice the VRAM (4 GB). The TrueTone feature of the display is also new and familiar from other Apple products.
                    
                    We review the more expensive SKU of the two pre-configured models for 3299 Euros. This will buy you a Core i7-8850H, 16 GB RAM, the Radeon Pro 560X, and 512 GB SSD storage. Apple charges a hefty premium for options, especially the memory and storage. If you select all the possible upgrades, you will have to pay 7959 Euros. Even mobile workstations with better components and service options are usually less expensive. We purchased our test model directly from Apple; it is not a press sample from the manufacturer.</string>
